v0.02: November XX, 2001:
-------------------------
- Virtual machine supports variable references (to fixed and variable-sized
  heap variables), but there is no heap allocation or freeing support yet. It
  also supports records, internal procedure calls and exception handling. It is
  capable to perform qsort procedure on a given array. Supported instructions:
  INC, DEC, ADD, SUB, MUL, JNZ, JG, JNG, JE, CPI1, CPI2, CPI4, CPI8, PUSH,
  PUSHR, PUSHH, POP, JMP, CPB, LDE, LDB, LDR, STE, STB, STR, CALL, THROW, RET.

- Added support of Cygwin (GCC 3.4.4).

- Written some docs, including virtual machine specification.


v0.01: September 06, 2011:
--------------------------
- Written S-expression parser. It will be used in future assembler and
  compiler. Identifies brackets, integers, floats, strings and symbols.

- Implemented simple VM prototype which support stack variables (no references,
  no multiple elements). The prototype is capable to compute factorial.
  Supported instructions: AST, FST, MOVM8, MOVN8, UMUL, DEC, JNZ, RET.
