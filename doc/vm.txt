1. Virtual machine design goals

* Memory-safe environment in a simple address space;
* Transparent remote procedure calls;
* Design as simple as possible;
* High performance on multicore CPU;

2. Variables

When thread executes a module procedure it reads and writes variables. Each
variable is a sequential block of memory organized as an array of equal sized
elements. Structure of a variable element is determined by a variable type and
it cannot be changed in runtime. Module has an array of predefined variable
types which cannot be changed at module lifetime. Variable is always defined by
variable specificator which contains flags for special options, id of variable
type and element count.

Variable type describes 3 possible sequential sections in variable element:

* bytes: size of byte array which is available for arithmetic and logical
  manipulations;
* vrefs: variable type ids which correspond to array of variable references;
