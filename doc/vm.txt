1. Virtual machine design goals

- To establish a memory-safe concurrent environment in a single address space;
- To support transparent remote procedure calls;
- To be as simple as possible, but not simpler;

2. Variables

When thread executes a module procedure it reads and writes variables. Each
variable is a sequential block of memory organized as an array of equal sized
elements. Structure of a variable element is determined by a variable type.
