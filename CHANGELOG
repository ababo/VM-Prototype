v0.02: November XX, 2001:
-------------------------
- The virtual machine supports references to fixed and variable-sized heap
  variables, but there is no heap allocation/deallocation support yet. It also
  supports records, internal procedure calls and exception handling. It is
  capable to perform qsort of a given array. Supported instructions: INC, DEC,
  ADD, SUB, MUL, JNZ, JG, JNG, JE, CPI1, CPI2, CPI4, CPI8, PUSH, PUSHR, PUSHH,
  POP, JMP, CPB, LDE, LDB, LDR, STE, STB, STR, CALL, THROW, RET.

- Added Cygwin (GCC 3.4.4) compatibility.

- Written some docs, including virtual machine specification.


v0.01: September 06, 2011:
--------------------------
- Written S-expression parser. It will be used in future assembler and
  compiler. It recognizes brackets, integers, floats, strings and symbols.

- Implemented simple VM prototype which supports stack variables (no references,
  no multiple elements). The prototype is capable to compute factorial.
  Supported instructions: AST, FST, MOVM8, MOVN8, UMUL, DEC, JNZ, RET.
